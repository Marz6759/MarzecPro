#To my dear Uncle Shumon, I have finished most of the coding necessary to install the features onto the device, however, in my attempt to
 clumsily try to make the app's GUI more 'fancy', I have lost track of some of the java classes. I also need to add the coding for the right
 commands get executed when asked for,for example, when the user presses on metasploit, the bash command in the chroot enviroment shall be
 'msfconsole' or when asking for Hydra, the simple bash command shall be 'hydra' and so on. But I believe that it wont be much of a problem, as the
 coding behind it is not too much of a hassle, however if you would kindly review the boot scripts, chrooting enviroment and the installation
 script, it would mean a lot to me.
